# Cloverfield Boilerplate Scaffold Generator

Cloverfield is a greenfield next-generation JavaScript project boilerplate. Or, it will be. Please help us decide what this will be by looking at the [open issues](https://github.com/ericelliott/cloverfield/issues).


## Why Cloverfield?

Every project has to start somewhere. So why not start with a project that already has best-in-class static analysis tools, task runners, easy test framework setup, painless isomorphic application framework, and just the right number of folders and scaffolds with just the right names?


## What should Cloverfield be?

Cloverfield should be prescriptive about chosing the right tooling, with an emphasis on flexibility looking into the future.


## What should Cloverfield not be?

Cloverfield should not be strongly tied to any particular framework-of-the-minute. That means Angular, Ember, Meteor -- you're out of luck. But don't dispair... frameworks are not the only way forward. We'll lean heavily toward established web standards, and help you figure out how to integrate them smoothly with your framework of choice.


## Why do we need yet another boilerplate / generator / scaffoldy thing?

Because yo generators suck. They install everything including the kitchen sink, and are usually married for eternity to some framework-of-the-minute. Choosing to use a generator shouldn't mean that you're opting into a billion things. We should be able to say `$ cf test` and *no matter which framework we're using, a sensible test framework should be scaffolded for us with some sample tests that can successfully run headless or against something like Sauce Labs out of the box.*

In other words, having all the choices made for you is bad. **Having all the meaningless choices made for you is better.**

The tech selections don't matter **at all** as long as developers love to use our tools. In fact, it might turn out that we use yo generators under the hood (if that makes sense) and `cf` *simply selects generators for you that don't suck.*


## Didn't the monster in the movie die?

Think of this like an ice sculpture. It will have its season, and then something better will come along. That's ok.


## Wasn't Cloverfield a gigantic monster?

Yeah, we're going to avoid giving you a whole bunch of crap you may never need, and instead concentrate on just the basics that **almost every JavaScript app will need.** It'll be modular. You'll be able to pick and chose which selections you want to scaffold out, but there will be a lot of options available. In the real world, production apps are big. Get over it. This isn't an app, anyway, it's a way for you to quickly get started on any JavaScript project.

Think of it as Yoeman without the obnoxious cruft you never wanted in the first place. Using a typical `yo` generator is like trying to coax a kitten out of a tree with a cannon. We won't be doing that.

We're not going to let you chose from everything ever made available on npm. That's what `npm` is for. We're going to pick the technologies that are really solid choices, and will likely remain really solid choices for a long time.

Think of it as a gigantic monster than can turn itself into a nimble jaguar. It is what you want it to be, and no more, and we won't overwhelm you with a crazy number of options. We'll pick the best and fewest tools possible in each category and move on.

Welcome to the field.
