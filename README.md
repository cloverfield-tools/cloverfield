# Cloverfield Boilerplate Scaffold Generator

Cloverfield aims to create a greenfield, next generation JavaScript project boilerplate scaffolding tool. That means we'll use the tools that coders in-the-know will be using over the next 1 - 3 years. We're starting with the 2016 edition. [Read more](https://github.com/ericelliott/cloverfield/blob/master/README.md).

Please help us decide what this will be by looking at the [open issues](https://github.com/ericelliott/cloverfield/issues).

## Why Cloverfield?

> "Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful." - John Maeda

Developers spend too much time making tech selections that ultimately have very little to do with the app they're building. Cloverfield's recommended tech selections are curated by experts who have built many apps used by millions of people.

Every project has to start somewhere. So why not start with a project that already has best-in-class static analysis tools, task runners, easy test framework setup, painless [universal JavaScript application](https://leanpub.com/learn-javascript-react-nodejs-es6/) framework, and just the right number of folders and scaffolds with just the right names?


## What should Cloverfield be?

Cloverfield should be prescriptive about chosing the right tooling, with an emphasis on flexibility looking into the future. It should help users make good choices that build on web platform standards that will survive long term, not get thrown away with last year's fashions.


## What should Cloverfield not be?

Cloverfield should not be strongly tied to any particular framework-of-the-minute. Angular, Ember, Meteor users, please try to contribute in a way that the rest of the community can benefit from. We'll lean heavily toward established web standards, and help you figure out how to integrate them smoothly with **your framework of choice.**

Any scaffolds for specific library ecosystems should use the library in the title, e.g.: `cf-react-application`


## Why do we need yet another boilerplate / generator / scaffoldy thing?

The yo generator ecosystem is aging, and the tools used by yo generators don't fit easily into modern JavaScript application workflows. Yeoman backed Bower for front-end tooling instead of looking to the future of universal JavaScript apps and standard ES6 modules packaged on npm. Bower's share of the package repo market is miniscule. It's clear that the future belongs to npm.
